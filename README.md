I want to propose a turn-based card game. The main objective of this game will be for players to battle enemies in random encounters and earn action points. The players' goal is to collect action points and items, and use these action points to climb the tower to the top.

For this project, I can think of three challenges:
1. Rendering the game correctly, whether it's implemented in 2D or 3D, will be a challenge. In the case of 2D, solving perspective mathematics to create the illusion of 3D depth is necessary. In the case of 3D, creating an effective camera system will be a challenge.
2. Setting up the random generation of enemies and action point values, as well as randomizing various resources for monsters, will involve designing data structures, and designing methods to access attribute values in these data structures is an important aspect of object-oriented programming.
3. Creating an interactive user interface that allows players to manage their card decks, view card information, and perform actions. Using Processing's drawing capabilities to render UI elements (such as buttons, text, and card images) will involve implementing interface design and interaction logic.

## Dungeon Crawler Game Idea

I'd like to suggest a first person dungeon crawler game, which could be implemented in either 2D or 3D.
This game would involve the player traversing a dungeon environment, fighting enemies in random
encounters. The player would aim to collect treasure and get deeper in the dungeon, as well as
obtain items which could make them stronger or which provide healing effects.

Three challenges I can think of for this project include:

1. Whether the game is implemented using 2D or 3D, getting the game to render appropriately will
be a challenge. In the case of 2D, it will be necessary to work out perspective maths so that
the illusion of 3D depth is created. In the case of 3D, creating a functioning camera system will
be a challenge.

2. Creating smooth and appropriate transitions between game states (start screen, dungeon
traversal, combat, etc).

3. Creating a combat system with sufficient balance and depth will pose a challenge
in the development of this game idea.
