# Conclusion

Developing *Deck of Doom* tested us on our ability to develop software as a group and offered a look into the challenges which we might face in industry. For those of us on the team interested in pursuing game development further, it was also valuable experience in how to properly lay out a game's systems and get a prototype up and running. Overall, we are satisfied with having been able to develop a complex game architecture which provides for an engaging gameplay experience while retaining the capacity for extensibility. 


Looking back over the development approach we used, our decision to split work on the game states among each team member had both positive and negative aspects. On the negative side, it initially slowed down the pace of development as certain states had to be completed before others could be tested. The need to spend some extra time and effort ensuring that all members understood how to integrate their work within the overarching system also contributed to the delay. On the positive side, this approach largely eliminated version control issues, allowed each team member to take ownership of a clear contribution to the project and provided ample experience for code reviews.

Overcoming the challenges we faced (creating game assets, fine-tuning game balance and integrating the game states) was done through regular team discussion via GitHub, WhatsApp and in person. Drawing on each other's areas of expertise was also critical to surmounting these obstacles, particularly in the realm of game assets, where several team members had existing skills and interests. Regarding improving game balance, user feedback through the use of the NASA Task Load Index and the System Usability Survey proved invaluable. These, alongside the Think Aloud technique, drove the next few stages of development as we knew which features needed improving and what to implement next. 

We used an agile development methodology when developing Deck of Doom. We had iterative progress, implementing features in sprints and carrying out user testing. However, it could have been useful to use the Planning Poker technique to estimate the effort required to complete different features of the game. 

On reflection, we could have dealt better with the fact that we had numerous deadlines in the same time period as the game's development. Nonetheless, through joint discussion we came to agreement on which tasks to prioritize so that we were able to achieve our goals. Related to this, it would have been beneficial in hindsight to have arranged more 'game jam'-style development sessions earlier in the development process.

If we were to develop this game further in the future, we would be keen to create a multiplayer mode to enable players to face off against each other with their own deck. For the map state, casino-style minigames available through nodes on the map would offer an additional avenue for the player to have fun and obtain in-game money or rare cards. With more time, refactoring of the game's combat system could expand the game's strategic possibilities even further by enabling enemy behaviours and card effects which the current system cannot easily implement.

In conclusion, the project has been a success for us, from the standpoint of seeking valuable experience of team-based software engineering and developing an understanding of the Agile workflow.
