In conclusion, we developed a vast amount of skills whilst creating our game. We successfully maintained good communication throughout the project through the use of Whatsapp, Github as well as weekly meetings. We developed an in-depth knowledge into evaluation techniques both qualitative and quantitative which was essential in making sure our game met our user requirements.  Indeed, we used the Think Aloud technique which gave us an insight into the user experience. We also used the Nasa Task Load Index and the System Usability questionnaires. The evaluation provided a lot of guidance as to how we should develop and improve our game. 

We used an agile workflow that worked well with the projects we were able to have iterative progress implementing features in springs. We could create features for the game and then soon after receive user testing that would then drive further development on the game. In order to immerse ourselves more fully in Agile methodology, in the future it could be useful to use scrum meetings 3 times a week in order to have a greater clarification over what the team needed to achieve. Furthermore, it would have useful to have carried out a Planning Poker in order to estimate the effort required to complete different tasks. 

On reflection, we could have dealt better with the fact that we had many deadlines in the same period of time which meant that certain tasks need to be rescheduled to another time. Furthermore, we could have implemented game-jams earlier on in the development process. Initially as a team we struggled to smoothly transition between different game states yet after doing game jam sessions this issue was solved. 

If we were to develop this game further in the future, we would be keen to make the game multiplayer. Furthermore, for the map state, it would be useful to add more nodes that would allow the user to play casino style mini games i.e. where you can bet money in order to get more cards. Furthermore,  we could make the game more flexible so that you could have different card effects and enemy behaviours. We could also develop different characters in the game that play differently from each other.
