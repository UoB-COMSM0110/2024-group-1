	General feedback from session 
⁃	Get rid of combat button + shop button from menu screen -> so that the flow of the game is more clear (should just click on the start button etc)
⁃	
⁃	Get rid of shop button in end screen + clear up unnecessary buttons from end screen 
⁃	
⁃	Make the game a little harder to win -> too easy at the moment to win
⁃	
⁃	Other cards will be incorporated once shop state is implemented -> make deck of cards in game available more diverse
⁃	
⁃	Need to have a tutorial implemented in the help section
⁃	
	- 	Should be more clear in the combat state how you attack the enemy (i.e clicking on card and then clicking on the monster)
	- 	Also it should be clear what the symbol above the monster is/does

⁃	It is worth us doing another round of user tests when we’ve developed the game more 
⁃	Make the tutorial in map a little easier to follow? 
⁃	Make the Ap less generous
⁃	Need to stop map temp json file being automatically generated? 
⁃	Green dot at the top node of map a little confusing
