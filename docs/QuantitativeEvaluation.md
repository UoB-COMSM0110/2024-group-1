## Think Aloud Evaluations

We conducted qualitative evaluations at three distinct stages of the game development. The feedback was instrumental in shaping subsequent development phases, providing clear guidance on which features needed enhancement or implementation.

### Think Aloud Evaluation 1 - Date: 2024-03-18

#### Positive Feedback
- "I really like the concept of the game."
- "The menu looks great! I love the artwork."

#### Negative Feedback
- "A tutorial in the map would be great."
- "Maybe there should be a clearer button for the player to know how to end the turn in the combat state."

#### Reflection on User Feedback
- It was evident that users were struggling with the map's usage. As a remedy, we introduced a tutorial in the Map State.
- Users were uncertain about how to conclude a turn in the combat state. In response, we designed a clearly labeled 'end turn' button in the combat state.

### Think Aloud Evaluation 2 - Date: 2024-04-16

#### Positive Feedback
- "The graphics look good."
- "This is a fun game!"
- "I think itâ€™s great that you can use either the keyboard or a mouse as a control."

#### Negative Feedback
- "I think a tutorial would help."
- "The game is too easy!"
- "The yellow and red nodes on first glance look very similar as your eye is first drawn to the combat icons which are the same image."

#### Reflection on User Feedback
- Users felt unsure of how to play the game. To address this, we developed a tutorial accessible from the menu.
- The game start process was unclear. We modified the menu to improve the game's flow and clarity.
- Users had difficulty determining the game's outcome. We added explanatory text in the End State.
- The game difficulty was too low. We adjusted the game balance, adding both hard and easy levels.
- The similarity in color between different nodes (yellow and red) was confusing. We changed the node colors to green and red for better contrast and clarity.
- The purpose of the symbol above the enemy in the combat state was obscure. We included a tutorial in the combat state explaining each symbol.

### Think Aloud Evaluation 3 - Date: 2024.04.27

#### Positive Feedback
- "I think the music is catchy!"
- "I like that you can buy more cards in the shop and use them to fight the monster!"

#### Negative Feedback
- "The text after you win looks all squished together."

#### Reflection on User Feedback
- We improved the End State display to space out the text more appropriately.
