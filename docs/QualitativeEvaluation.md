## Think Aloud Evaluation

We collected qualitative evaluations at 3 different stages of the game. The feedback we received shaped the next few stages of development as we knew what features needed improving and which features needed to be implemented. 

### Think Aloud Evaluation 1 - Date: 2024-03-18

#### Positive Feedback
- "I really like the concept of the game."
- "The menu looks great! I love the artwork."

#### Negative Feedback
- "A tutorial for the map would be great."
- "Maybe there should be a clearer button for the player to know how to end the turn in the combat state."

#### Reflection on User Feedback
- It was clear that users did not understand how to use the map. Therefore, we created a tutorial in the Map State. 
- Users were not sure how to end a turn in the combat state. In response,we created a clearly marked ‘end turn’ button in the combat state. 

### Think Aloud Evaluation 2 - Date: 2024-04-16

#### Positive Feedback
- "The graphics look good."
- "This is a fun game!"
- "I think it’s great that you can use either the keyboard or a mouse as a control."

#### Negative Feedback
- "I think a tutorial would help."
- "The game is too easy!"
- "The yellow and red nodes at first glance look very similar as your eye is first drawn to the combat icons which are the same image."

#### Reflection on User Feedback
- Users felt unsure how to play the game. To solve this issue, we created a tutorial in the menu. 
- It was unclear how the user should start the game. We modified the menu so the flow of the game was far easier to follow. 
- Users were unsure whether they had won or lost the game. We included text in the End State to indicate this. 
- It was far too easy to win the game. We altered the game balance so that it was more challenging to defeat the enemies. We implemented a hard and an easy level. 
- Users felt that the colour of the different nodes on the map (yellow and red) on first glance looked too similar and were confusing. We changed the node colours to green and red to provide a greater contrast, making it clearer which nodes on the map were clickable. 
- It was unclear what the symbol above the enemy in the combat state meant. We therefore created a tutorial in the combat state showing the meaning of each symbol. 

### Think Aloud Evaluation 3 - Date: 2024.04.27

#### Positive Feedback
- "I think the music is catchy!"
- "I like that you can buy more cards in the shop and use them to fight the monster!"

#### Negative Feedback
- "The text after you win looks a bit squished together."

#### Reflection on User Feedback
- We modified the display of the End State so that the text was more appropriately spaced out.
