Think Aloud notes for evaluation section 



-	Participant 1 (Hamish)
o	‘What do I do now ? ‘
o	‘I think a tutorial would help’ 
o	‘The active card is strike do I just click on it again ?’
o	‘How do I know if the monster is doing any damage to me’ -> not clear at first that HP was going down 
o	It wasn’t clear that you should click on the start button to begin the game and not the combat button. 
o	‘Is there any benefit to not just using all your cards ?’ 
o	Should be more clear in the win screen -> saying something like ‘you’ve won’ etc
o	‘’there’s too much mental load, I got bored reading the tutorial especially reading the word ‘node’ too many times’’
o	‘You should remove the black lines that are in the combat state’ (left over from map state? 
o	Node maybe sounds too technical sounding -> is there a different more user friendly term we could use? 


-	Participant 2 (Finn)
o	‘I really like the graphics!’
o	‘The help button doesn’t work’
o	‘I’m not sure what to do’ 
o	Used the combat button instead of going on the start button
o	‘I don’t know how to attack using the card’
o	‘Can I just use all the cards?’
o	‘It might be useful when you press end turn to see something happen in the screen’
o	In tutorial -> make it clear how to use the attack and defense cards and what the defense card actually does
o	‘Did I win?’
o	‘What is the objective again?’ 
o	‘Bit unclear how you can access top level already’



-	Participant 3 (Julia) 
o	‘What’s happening?’
o	‘Node tree is triggering me’ -> too technical sounding? 
o	‘ I really like that you can use the keyboard or mouse as controls’
o	‘where am I?’
o	‘I’m confused’
o	‘How much defence do I have?’
o	‘What does the symbol above the monster mean?’

-	Participant 4 (Florence )
o	‘The game looks really cool!’ 
o	‘That was fun to play!’ 
o	‘Help button doesn’t work ‘
